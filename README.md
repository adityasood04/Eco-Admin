# EcoBeach

## Introduction

EcoBeach is a platform dedicated to addressing the issue of beach pollution, which poses a threat to aquatic life and leads to the erosion of beaches. Our initiative aims to mitigate this problem through collaborative efforts between NGOs, participants, and eco-friendly businesses.

### Website

The EcoBeach website serves as a central hub for participants to learn about upcoming beach clean-up competitions in their areas. It provides information on events, allows registration, and enables participants to track their EcoPoints, which are earned during competitions.

### Admin App

The EcoBeach Admin App complements our website by providing NGOs with comprehensive event management tools. This app streamlines the supervision of beach clean-up competitions and facilitates the update of participant EcoPoints in real-time.
